# tisha_android_code_source


This is code source of game writting in java for android . i wrote this code years ago when i was try to learn java on android . 
the game is actually strategy game for kids (see the video to get clear idea ..). the Algoritme of AI is MinMax .
it was my first application , so the code's structure is terrible and don't respect the standars niether the norms .I  share it here , hoping 
that someone else take this idea or this code and develope it to better version .
