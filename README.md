# tisha_android_code_source


This is the code source of game written in Java for android. I wrote this code years ago when I was trying to learn Java on android. the game is actually a strategy game for kids (see the video to get a clear idea..). the Algoritme of AI is MinMax.it was my first application, so the code's structure is terrible and don't respect the standards never the norms.I  share it here, hoping that someone else takes this idea or this code and develop it to better versions.
